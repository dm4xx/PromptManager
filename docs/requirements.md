# Prompt Manager Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the Prompt Manager application, a native Windows desktop application designed to support prompt-engineering workflows. The application is built entirely in Rust and runs locally without external dependencies.

### 1.2 Scope
The application provides tools for managing prompt-based conversations with AI services, maintaining a versioned history of interactions, and supporting efficient workflow management.

### 2.2 Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Core Features
1. **Prompt Editor**
   - Multi-line text editor for prompt composition
   - Character counter with configurable maximum length (default: 750)
   - Copy functionality (Tab key) that copies entire editor content
   - Standard Windows text operations (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) preserved

2. **AI Service Integration**
   - Supported services: Gemini, NotebookLM, Perplexity, ChatGPT
   - Service selection via dropdown menu
   - Default service: ChatGPT

3. **Conversation Management**
   - Tree-based conversation history
   - Nodes represent sequential prompts, not versions
   - Parent-child relationships for conversation branching
   - Timestamp tracking for each prompt

4. **History Panel**
   - Interactive tree view of conversation history
   - Search functionality with real-time filtering
   - Branching capability from any node
   - Auto-scroll to bottom on new prompt creation

5. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful error recovery
   - User-friendly error dialogs
   - Database integrity checks
   - Automatic backup before critical operations

#### 2.2.2 User Interface Requirements
1. **Main Window Layout**
   - Clean, modern design with clear separation of components
   - Responsive layout
   - High contrast mode support

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Toggle History Panel: Ctrl+H
   - Search History: Ctrl+F
   - Fullscreen Editor: F11
   - Copy Prompt: Tab

3. **Menu System**
   - File: New Tree, Open, Export, Exit
   - Edit: Undo/Redo, Delete Version
   - View: Show/Hide History, Fullscreen
   - Settings: Font Size, Storage Path, Accessibility
   - Help: Documentation, Report Issue, About

#### 2.2.3 Configuration Options
1. **Font Size**
   - Global font size adjustment
   - Configurable sizes: 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 16pt
   - Preserved between sessions

2. **Storage Settings**
   - Custom storage path selection
   - Automatic database backup
   - Local-only storage (no encryption required)

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen-reader compatibility
   - High contrast mode
   - Configurable keyboard shortcuts

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.3.1 Performance
- Fast database operations for prompt saving
- Smooth UI interactions
- Efficient text rendering
- Quick search response

#### 2.3.2 Security
- No external dependencies beyond Rust crates
- Secure-by-default approach
- No disk-level encryption required
- Input validation for all text fields

#### 2.3.3 Maintainability
- Clear code organization
- Comprehensive error logging
- Configurable logging levels
- Easy dependency management

### 2.4 Implementation Constraints
1. **Technology Stack**
   - Only stable Rust crates allowed
   - No custom or private crates
   - All dependencies from crates.io
   - Single-binary distribution

2. **Distribution**
   - Simple installation (unzip + run .exe)
   - No Visual C++ redistributables required
   - No external binary dependencies

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Must allow basic functionality even with database issues
   - Provide manual export/import options
   - Include automatic backup creation

## 3. Rationale

### 3.1 Design Decisions

#### 3.1.1 Tree Structure
- Chosen over flat list for better conversation tracking
- Allows natural branching of conversations
- Maintains temporal order (older = higher)
- Enables easy navigation between related prompts

#### 3.1.2 Font Size Configuration
- Added for accessibility
- Global adjustment for consistency
- Preserved between sessions for user convenience

#### 3.1.3 Keyboard Shortcuts
- Minimal set to avoid conflicts
- Tab key chosen for copy functionality due to unique behavior
- Standard Windows shortcuts preserved

### 3.2 Technical Decisions

#### 3.2.1 Sled Database
- Pure-Rust implementation
- Single-binary distribution
- No external dependencies
- Free for commercial use
- Minimal supply-chain footprint

#### 3.2.2 Slint GUI Framework
- Modern, actively maintained
- First-class Windows support
- Stable release available
- Good performance characteristics
- Accessibility support

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
